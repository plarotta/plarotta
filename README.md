### Hi there 👋

I'm Pedro, and I'm a Master's student at Columbia working at the intersection of Robotics and ML 🤖
- 🔭 I’m currently working on applying meta learning to intent inferral at the ROAM lab (https://roam.me.columbia.edu/)
- 🎮 I've gotten to work on some cool projects throughout my time at Columbia, and some of them might be useful to others. Check out my code for
    - Implementing a neural network from scratch (no PyTorch or Tensorflow)
    - Learning the basics of genetic programming through the Traveling Salesman Problem
    - Training a model to predict the joint configuration of a robot arm from vision alone
    - *attempting* to learn a policy for navigating mazes from just the first person view of the agent
    - My first attempt at a pipeline for meta learning to train EMG models capable of quickly adapting to new patients (context: https://roam.me.columbia.edu/research-projects/hand-orthosis-stroke-rehabilitation)
    - Transfer learning for image classification (ResNets and Vision Transformers)
- ✍️ Let me know if you have any questions about my repos or are interested in collaboration
